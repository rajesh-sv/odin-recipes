    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Paneer Butter Masala recipe is a rich and creamy dish of paneer (Indian cottage cheese)
      in a tomato, butter and cashew sauce that is known here as “Makhani gravy.” The acidity of the
      tomatoes and the sweetness of the cream make for a velvety, nearly addictive sauce.</p> 
    <p>Also known as “Butter Paneer,” this yummy and popular vegetarian dish is derived from the recipe
      for Butter Chicken, a.k.a. Chicken Makhani, that I learned to make during my cooking school days. 
      I know, I know, the thought of me cooking with meat sounds insane. It seems nearly a lifetime ago!</p>
